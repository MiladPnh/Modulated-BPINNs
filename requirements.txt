tensorflow>=2.8.0: Specifies that your project needs TensorFlow version 2.8.0 or newer. Adjust this to match the TensorFlow version you are actually using (e.g., tensorflow==2.10.0 for a specific version, or tensorflow~=2.8 for any 2.8.x version).
numpy>=1.20.0, scipy>=1.7.0, matplotlib>=3.4.0, imageio>=2.9.0: Similar version specifications for other libraries. It's good practice to specify minimum versions you've tested with.
# tensorflow-addons: I've commented this out because it wasn't in your final provided code's import list. If you add it back to your Python scripts, uncomment it here and ensure version compatibility.
# argparse: The argparse module is part of Python's standard library, so you don't need to (and shouldn't) include it in requirements.txt for pip installation.
To generate a requirements.txt from your current environment (recommended after you've installed everything):
If you are using a virtual environment (which is highly recommended):
Activate your virtual environment.
Run: pip freeze > requirements.txt
This will capture all packages and their exact versions in your current environment. You can then manually edit this file to set minimum versions (e.g., change tensorflow==2.10.0 to tensorflow>=2.10.0) or remove packages that are not direct dependencies of your project.
